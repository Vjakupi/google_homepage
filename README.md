# google_homepage
This project, started on March 17th, 2021 marks the first step toward a process I've wanted to do for several years now. I am tasked with creating a replica of Google's homepage primarily using html and CSS.

The idea behind this exercise is to push myself to think critically about the elements that go into the creation of a web page.

Rather than following along with a tutorial, I'm lost in the woods now with no direct instruction as how to proceed.

I will add a revision complete with a reflection to this README after I have completed the project.
